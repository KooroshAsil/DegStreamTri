# 🔍 Deep Dive into Triangle Counting with Degeneracy

Welcome to **DegStreamTri**—my semester-long adventure into the fascinating world of graph streams and triangle counting! This repository chronicles my deep dive into the research article *"How the Degeneracy Helps for Triangle Counting in Graph Streams"* by Suman K. Bera and C. Seshadhri. As a computer science student, I’m here to unpack this cutting-edge work, master its concepts, and craft a compelling presentation. Expect detailed notes, insights, and progress updates as I go!

## 🔍 **What’s This About?**

This project is my quest to decode how **graph degeneracy**—a clever measure of a graph’s sparsity—supercharges triangle counting in the streaming model. The article explores an algorithm that leverages this property to efficiently process massive graphs with limited memory. My goals are threefold:

- **Understand the Tech**: Grasp the algorithm, its probabilistic analysis, and the lower bound proof.
- **Bridge Theory & Practice**: Show how degeneracy tackles real-world graph challenges.
- **Share the Story**: Build a presentation that makes these ideas crystal clear and exciting.

This repo is my workbench—full of notes, code snippets, and reflections as I piece it all together.

## 💡 **Why It Matters**

My instructor threw down the gauntlet: dive into advanced research and emerge with insights worth sharing. This project isn’t just homework—it’s a chance to wrestle with big ideas in graph algorithms and streaming. Here’s what hooked me:

- **The Puzzle**: Why does degeneracy unlock efficiency in graph streams?
- **The Stakes**: How does this apply to massive datasets like social networks or web graphs?
- **The Payoff**: I’ll sharpen my skills in analysis, coding, and communication—tools for any CS career.

## 📚 **Prerequisites**

To join me on this journey (or follow the article), here’s what you’ll need. I’ve split it into **must-haves** and **extras**, with quick notes on why they matter:

### **Must-Haves**
- **Graph Theory** 🌐: Know your nodes, edges, and triangles. *Why?* It’s the backbone of the article’s concepts.
- **Algorithms** ⚡: Get comfy with complexity and optimization. *Why?* We’re squeezing efficiency out of limited space.
- **Probability** 🎲: Expectation and bounds like Chernoff are your friends. *Why?* The algorithm’s accuracy hinges on probabilistic tricks.
- **Streaming Basics** 🌊: One-pass data processing with tiny memory. *Why?* That’s the game we’re playing!

### **Extras**
- **Communication Complexity** 📡: Helps with the lower bound proof.
- **Sampling** 🎯: Think reservoir sampling for stream processing.
- **Real-World Graphs** 🕸️: Insight into sparsity and structure is a bonus.

No worries if you’re rusty—I’ll break it down in my notes as I go!

## 🎯 **Goals to Conquer**

By semester’s end, I’m aiming to:

1. **Crack the Article** 📜: Fully digest the algorithm, analysis, and proofs.
2. **Make It Click** 🗣️: Explain degeneracy’s role in a way that’s simple yet profound.
3. **Link to Reality** 🌍: Tie this to practical problems in data science and beyond.
4. **Nail the Presentation** 🎤: Answer these big questions:
   - What’s degeneracy doing here?
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Why this approach?
   - Where’s it going next?
5. **Track My Growth** 📝: Fill this repo with insights and lessons learned.

## 🛠 **My Game Plan**

Here’s how I’ll tackle this beast:

- **Step 1: Read Deeply** 📖: Break the article into chunks, annotating every “aha!” and “huh?” moment.
- **Step 2: Write It Out** ✍️: Dump explanations and examples into `/notes/`—think of it as my brain on paper.
- **Step 3: Visualize** 🧠: Sketch diagrams for degeneracy, streams, and triangles.
- **Step 4: Test Myself** 🧩: Code small examples or solve problems to lock in the concepts.
- **Step 5: Present** 🎨: Build slides that pop, practice until it flows, and refine with feedback.

**Tools I’m Using**:
- **Jupyter** for quick code experiments.
- **Obsidian** to map out ideas.
- **GitHub** to log progress and questions.

## 🌍 **Real-World Impact**

This isn’t just theory—it’s got legs:

- **Social Networks** 🕸️: Counting triangles reveals communities and influencers.
- **Big Data** 💾: Streaming algorithms handle datasets too huge for traditional methods.
- **Skill Boost** 🔧: Researching and presenting like this preps me for tech challenges ahead.

Think analyzing Twitter trends or mapping protein interactions—triangle counting is everywhere!

## ❔ **Q&A + Hurdles**

Got questions? I’ve got answers (or will soon):

- **What’s degeneracy anyway?**  
  It’s the max minimum degree across subgraphs—a sparsity superpower for graphs like social networks.

- **Why streams?**  
  Because real-world data (e.g., web traffic) is too big to store—we process it on the fly!

- **Hurdle: That lower bound proof.**  
  Plan: Slow down, grab extra resources, and chip away at it step-by-step.
